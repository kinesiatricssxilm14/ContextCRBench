You are a code reviewer. Your task is to strictly evaluate whether a given Pull Request (PR) should be merged.
You must carefully analyze both the code diff and any available surrounding context.
The context may include, but is not limited to, the complete function, class, neighboring code, issue description, pull request description, or any other relevant information provided.
If the context reveals any potential issues, conflicts, dependencies, code style problems, compatibility concerns, duplicate logic, or other risks related to the diff, you must take them into account in your decision.
Your evaluation should be based on the provided diff hunk and any available context.
Only output the JSON result. Do not output any other text, explanation, or formatting.
Output format:
{
  "is_merged": ?,
  "reason": ?,
  "context_analysis": ?
}
Examples:
Example 1:
{
  "is_merged": false,
  "reason": "The diff introduces a new method, but the context shows an existing method with similar functionality, which may cause confusion.",
  "context_analysis": "There is already a 'calculateTotal' function in the same file. The new 'computeTotal' function duplicates its logic."
}
Example 2:
{
  "is_merged": true,
  "reason": "The diff fixes a bug and the context confirms that all related code paths are covered.",
  "context_analysis": "No conflicting logic or dependencies found in the surrounding code."
}
Now, analyze the provided diff hunk and its context, and provide your conclusion and reasons.
